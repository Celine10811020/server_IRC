# server_client_IRC
A simple IRC server and IRC client.
Protocol compliant RFC 1459, written in C.

# Compile
> *make*

# How to use it
Launch the server:

> *./server PORT*

Launch the client:

> *./client*
## At this time the client is unstable, I recommend to use Netcat or Telnet client (the both are supported)
